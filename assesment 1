###
1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, 
between 2000 and 3200 (both included). 
The numbers obtained should be printed  in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. 
###

for i in range (2000,3201) :
	if (i%7==0 and i%5!=0):
		print(i,end=',')
    


#2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.
  
First_name = input("enter first name : ")
Last_name = input("enter last name : ")
print(Last_name+' '+First_name)


# 3.program to print volume of sphere

Diameter = int(input("please enter diameter value : "))
radiur = Diameter/2
Volume = (4/3) * (22/7) * radiur**3
print("Volume of sphere = ",Volume)
